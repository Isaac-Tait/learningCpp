Define your goal
	Convert kilometer time in minutes to mile time in minutes.

Define requirements
	The user should be able to enter their minKph and the console returns their km split as a mile split.
	This assumes the users speed would not decrease since one mile is longer than one kilometer...

Define your tools, target, and backup plan
	The code will be used on Windows. I will write it alone. I will backup to GitHub.

Breakdown hard problems into easy problems
	One (1) kilometer equals 0.621371192 miles... 
	So, a 5m30s kilometer time would be converted to seconds or 330
	(330sec / 0.621371192) / 60 = 8.85139203min
	0.85139203 * 60 = 51.08 seconds
	8m51s per mile speed is equal to 5m30s per kilometer speed

Figure out the sequence of events
	Take the user's time minutes then seconds. Save them to variables "m" and "s". Multiply "m" by 60 then 
	add "m" and "s". Save to variable "k". 
	Divide "k" by 0.621371192. Save to variable "kk". Divide "kk" by 60.

	Hard part - take decimal from "kk" and multiply by 60. Save to variable "ns". 
	Take whole number from "kk" and append "ns" to the end. 

	Return that to the user (aka the console) in the format:
	 "If your speed remained the same, your 1km split of 5m30s, would be a 1 mile split of <num>m<num>s"
